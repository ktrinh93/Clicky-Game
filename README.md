# Clicky-Game

Clicky Game is a memory-esque game that presents users with similarly themed/styled images. Clicking on an image will shuffle the cards around. If the card has not been previously clicked on, the user's current score increments by one, and if it is beating their previous best, it will increment the top score too. Clicking on a previous selected image results in a loss, and the user's score is reset to zero(0). There are nine(9) possible points in this game.

This app uses React to handle UI rendering and manage its state.
